Code for OKC is an all volunteer group and we'd love to have you participate in any way that you can.

## Meetings

Code for OKC meets on the 4th Monday of each month at [StarSpace46](http://<www.starspace46".com/).

Please see our [Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-OKC/) for additional times and details, and to RSVP to let us know that you're coming.

On the second Wednesday of each month at 8pm we will host a virtual meeting on Slack.

## GitHub

Our main [discussion forum](https://github.com/codeforokc/discussions/issues) is hosted with GitHub. This is our primary means of collaboration and the best place to get up to date information about what's happening.

Some of our [projects](/projects) have dedicated repos on GitHub and will have their own discussions happening in the "issues" area.

## Chat

We also have a [Slack room](http://slack.codeforokc.org) where we can have real-time discussions when there are lots of details to get hammered out.

## Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct &amp; Anti-Harassment Policy](https://github.com/codeforokc/codeofconduct) details the expectations that we have for all contributors. We value your participation and hope that by communicating these expectations widely we can all enjoy a harassment-free environment.
